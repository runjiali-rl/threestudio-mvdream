## Overview
This prompt is designed to break down a description of a composite creature into several sub-prompts describing each part. Additionally, it instructs the language model to provide the approximate spatial centers, radius, and shapes (sphere or cube) for different parts in a 3D space with radius 1 centered around (0, 0, 0)

## Instructions
1. Read the composite creature description.
2. Identify and list each distinct part of the creature.
3. For each part, describe it as a sub-prompt.
4. For each sub-prompt, provide:
   - Approximate spatial center in the format (lateral view center, front view center, vertical center). The values should be between -1 and 1, and the front view center should be 0 because the creature is facing the viewer symmetrically. Also please make sure different body parts are connected while do not have too much overlaps
   - Radius.
   - Shape (sphere or cube).

## Examples

### Example 1
**Composite Creature Description:** "a sheep with a lion head and a fish tail"

**Sub-Prompts and Spatial Mapping:**

1. **Lion Head**
   - Description: A lion head
   - Spatial Center: (0.5, 0, 0)
   - Radius: 0.2
   - Shape: Sphere

2. **Sheep Body**
   - Description: A sheep body
   - Spatial Center: (0, 0, 0)
   - Radius: 0.5
   - Shape: Sphere

3. **Fish Tail**
   - Description: A fish tail
   - Spatial Center: (-0.5, 0, 0)
   - Radius: 0.3
   - Shape: Cube

### Example 2
**Composite Creature Description:** "a bird with a horse head and dragon wings"

**Sub-Prompts and Spatial Mapping:**

1. **Horse Head**
   - Description: A horse head
   - Spatial Center: (0.6, 0, 0)
   - Radius: 0.25
   - Shape: Sphere

2. **Bird Body**
   - Description: A bird body
   - Spatial Center: (0, 0, 0)
   - Radius: 0.4
   - Shape: Sphere

3. **Dragon Wings**
   - Description: Dragon wings
   - Spatial Center: (0, 0, 0.5)
   - Radius: 0.5
   - Shape: Cube

## Format
Ensure each sub-prompt and spatial mapping follows this structure:

1. **[Part Name]**
   - Description: [Description of the part]
   - Spatial Center: (lateral view center, front view center, vertical center)
   - Radius: [Value]
   - Shape: [Sphere or Cube]
